For Uncleaned Dataset, there is lesser density of price in New York city due to lower booking rates. When compared the same to Private room and Entire home or apartment, we see the graph gets denser. However, we need further analysis to get the correct data as itâ€™s an uncleaned data set.

For Cleaned Dataset, we can clearly analyse the density of prices across all 3 room types and Private rooms has the highest denser plot in the region.

For reviews in specific years based on room types from year 2011-2019, we can clearly depict there is an exponential growth of the reviews received from year 2011-2019. Moreover, we see a huge jump of reviews received in 2019 as compared to the previous year 2018.
For the year 2011-2019, Private room were always in demand and there was an overflowing of reviews received from the customers as compared to other room types after 2015.
