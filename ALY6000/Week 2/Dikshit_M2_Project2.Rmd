# Three Aspects Of Assignments

A. As per below mentioned ```Summary```, we got ```mean, median, first and third quartiles, min and max element```;```Mean``` of the dataset ```BullTroutRML2_Data(age)``` is ```5.771``` and ```Mean``` of dataset ```BullTroutRML2_Data(forklength)``` is ```326.1```;```Median``` of the dataset ```BullTroutRML2_Data(age)``` is ```6```and ```Median``` of the dataset ```BullTroutRML2_Data(forklength)``` is ```352.5```.

```Skewness of age``` is ```2.92``` and of ```forklength``` is ```112.20```;```Standard Deviation, Variance and Kurtosis``` values are  represented in the screenshots below. From Skewness, we can identify the graph is ```Asymmetric``` below the median or below the peak of the graph in both ```age``` and ```forklength```.

The ```outliers``` help in understanding the number of points outside the range of dataset given and can be calculated using ```boxplot graph``` which represents the ```minimum, maximum, mean and median``` of the dataset. Below, the boxplot of the ```age``` is calculated as we can see there are no points outside the minimum and maximum i.e., there are no points outside the range of the dataset and hence the outliers for the given dataset of age is ```Zero```.

![An image caption Source: Outliers](/Users/abidikshit/ScreenShot3.png)

The ```outliers of the dataset of forklength(fl)``` is calculated below where we can observe that there are outliers in the forklength which means there are points which goes beyond the range of the dataset i.e., outliers goes beyond ```500``` and lying within ```15``` which are the ranges as shown in the figure below.

B. Representing the Data Visualization of the ```Scatter plot, Histogram, Regression line with legend and Boxplot```. The ```scatter plot``` represents the dependency nature with an uphill graph which means as the forklength ```increases```, the age also ```increases``` and vice versa. Highest peak can be seen at ```(450,14)```. The next plot shows the same result as the scatter plot which shows there is a direct relation between the ```age and the frequency```.

In ```regression plot```, the slop of the line is the important equation and depicts how the variables are dependent on each other. In regression line we can see the peak point touching the line which is at ```(450,14)```. The legend represents the data in a clear way to understand the graph. 

The ```box plot``` of the forklength represents the data to understand the graph in a better way. The box plot of the forklength represents the outliers of the graph where the points lie ```outside``` the range of the forklength.

C. By observing the Data Visualization of all the ```graphs and plots```, we can conclude that all the minimal and maximum number and the maximum peak occurs same place with the exact magnitude in all the graphs and plots.

In the box plot of age, we observed there is ```no outliers``` since all the points lie in the range of age unlike forklength which has ```two outliers```.
