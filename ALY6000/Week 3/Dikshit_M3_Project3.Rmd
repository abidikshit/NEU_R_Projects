library(plyr)   # Load Libraries
library(FSA)
library(FSAdata)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
```

### 2. Import the *inchBio.csv* and name the table *bio*
```{r}
bio = read.csv("/Users/abidikshit/R_Language/inchBio.csv", sep=",",header=TRUE)
```

### Plot the statistics of *bio* Datasetƒ
```{r}
summary(bio)
```

### 3. Display the head, tail and structure of *bio*
```{r}
headTail(bio, ellipsis = F) 
bio_str = str(bio)
```

### 4. Create an object *counts* that counts and lists all the species records
```{r}
counts = dplyr::count(bio,species)
counts
```

### 5. Display just the 8 levels (names) of the species
```{r}
unique(bio[c("species")])
```

### 6. Create a *tmp* object that displays the different species and the number of record of each species in the dataset. Include this information in your report.
```{r}
tmp = table(bio['species'])
tmp
```

### 7. Create a subset *tmp2* of just the species variable and display the first five records
```{r}
tmp2 = subset(bio, select = 'species')
head(tmp2, 5)
```

### 8. Create a table *w* of the species variable. Display the *class* of w
```{r}
w = table(bio$species)
w
class(w)
```

### 9. Convert *w* to a data frame named *t* and display the results
```{r}
t = data.frame(w)
t
```

### 10. Extract and display the frequency values from the *t* data frame
```{r}
freq_data = t[,2]
freq_data
```

### 11. Create a table named *cSpec* from the bio species attribute (variable) and confirm that you created a table which displays the number of species in the dataset *bio*
```{r}
cSpec = table(bio$species)
cSpec
class(cSpec)
```

### 12. Create a table named *cSpecPct* that displays the species and percentage of records for each species. Confirm you created a table class.
```{r}
len_species = length(matrix(bio$species))
print(paste("Length of the species: ", len_species))
```

```{r}
cSpecPct = table(bio$species)/len_species
cSpecPct
class(cSpecPct)
```

### 13. Convert the table *cSpecPct* to a data frame named *u* and confirm that *u* is a data frame

### 17. Rename the *d* columns Var 1 to Species, and Freq to RelFreq
```{r}
names(d)[names(d) == "Var1"] = "Species"
names(d)[names(d) == "Freq"] = "RelFreq"
d
```

### 18. Add new variables to *d* and call them *cumfreq, counts, and cumcounts*
```{r}

## Three Aspects Of Assignments

A. Based on the ```inchBio``` Data analysis, out of ```676 observation``` in ```8 species``` there was a clear dominance of two species i.e., ```Largmouth Bass``` and ```Bluegill``` which contributes to ```66%``` of the research data whereas ```Pumpkin seed``` and ```Tadpole Madtom``` hardly contributed ```2%``` of the research data.

![An image caption Source: Species Count](/Users/abidikshit/R_Language/countspecies.png)

![An image caption Source: cSpecPct](/Users/abidikshit/R_Language/cSpecPct.png)

To facilitate an in-depth study of the data set, several subsets were created in order to analyze the ``Real frequency, cumulative frequency, counts and cumulative counts``` of the species data.

Largmouth Bass and Bluegill species have high survival rate because of the huge count as compared to the rest. Also, the frequency of reproduction of the other species w.r.t there survival rate is much more less, specially the ones with smaller length and width.

B. The advantages of a bar plot and a cumulative distribution graph are combined in the Pareto graphic that follows. We can see that two species predominate among the samples used in this investigation and the pareto graphic prompts us to give us a clear picture about a number of fresh lines of inquiry such as: 

1. Smaller pumpkin seed or tadpole species are a major source of food for bluegill and largemouth bass as compared to the rest.
2. There are environmental factors that prevent some species from flourishing in an environment where they share space with large species. For instance, smaller fish gets there food from the leftover of the species which are larger in length and mostly surround the area where they pas through to get an easy food.
3. As it was necessary to conduct a more in-depth analysis of species length and weight in order to determine if the species are developing poorly and, as a result, pose a reproductive risk or a risk of increased morbidity and mortality, we conducted several analysis to provide a better picture of the scenario.

![An image caption Source: Cumulative Counts Species Pareto Final](/Users/abidikshit/R_Language/CumulativeCountsSpeciesParetoFinal.png)

C. By looking at the Data Visualization of all of the "graphs and plots", the highest and lowest survival rate depends highly on the size of the specific species as well as on the scale of reproduction and the region where they breed and stay.

We may get the conclusion that the two prominent species in the below plots, the largemouth bass and bluegill, are the main predators and feed on the other species. All species eat "pumpkin seed" and "tadpole madtom," which makes it difficult for them to survive.
