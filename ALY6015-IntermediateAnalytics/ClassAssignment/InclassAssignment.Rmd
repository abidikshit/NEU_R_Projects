# print Student Name and roll number

# load data 
```{r}

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# 2. Comparing tooth growth by supp and dose using statistical tests
<!-- The below boxplot suggests a difference in the effect on length of supplement. -->
```{r}
library(plotly)
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
plot_ly(data=ToothGrowth, x=~supp, y=~len, type="box")
```

# Change ‘dose’ from numerical variable to factor variable
```{r}
ToothGrowth$dose = factor(ToothGrowth$dose, levels=c(0.5,1.0,2.0),labels=c("low","med","high"))   
```

```{r}
str(ToothGrowth)
```

# Replication
```{r}
replications(len ~ supp * dose, data=ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
replications(len ~ supp * dose, data=ToothGrowth[1:58,])
```

```{r}
aggregate(ToothGrowth$len, by=list(ToothGrowth$supp,ToothGrowth$dose), FUN = mean)
aggregate(ToothGrowth$len, by=list(ToothGrowth$supp,ToothGrowth$dose), FUN = sd)

dose <- factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
fit <- aov(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp*ToothGrowth$dose)
summary(fit)
```

```{r}
dose <- factor(dose)
fit <- aov(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp*ToothGrowth$dose)
summary(fit)
```

# Graphical Explanation
# Box Plot
```{r}
 boxplot(len ~ supp * dose, data=ToothGrowth, ylab="Tooth Length", main="Boxplots of Tooth Growth Data", col= "skyblue")
```

# Interaction Plot
```{r}
with(ToothGrowth, interaction.plot(x.factor=dose, trace.factor=supp,response=len, fun=mean, type="b", legend=T,ylab="Tooth Length", main="Interaction Plot",pch=c(1,19)))
```

# Conditional Plot
```{r}
coplot(len ~ dose | supp, data=ToothGrowth, panel=panel.smooth,xlab="ToothGrowth data: length vs dose, given type of supplement", col= "red")
```

# Using model.tables() function
<!-- Another way to get similar information is to use the model.tables( ) function, but the ANOVA has to be run first and saved into a model object. -->
```{r}
aov.out = aov(len ~ supp * dose, data=ToothGrowth)
```

<!-- The model formula specifies “length as a function of supplement and dose with all possible interactions between the factors. Now we can look at some model tables. -->
```{r}
model.tables(aov.out, type="means", se=T)
```

```{r}
summary(aov.out)
```

#Treatment Contrasts
<!-- check to make sure we’re getting treatment contrasts$contrasts -->
```{r}
options("contrasts")
```

```{r}
summary.lm(aov.out)
```

# Conclusion of the Hypothesis Testing
The mean of the OJ-low cell: We find this mean to be significantly different from zero, not an especially interesting result. The next line of the table, “suppVC”, shows the difference between the means of the VC-low cell and the OJ-low cell. 

The standard error is for the difference between these means, so the difference is found to be significant. The “dosemed” line shows the difference between the means of the OJ-med cell and the OJ-low cell, and once again this difference is found to be statistically significant. The “dosehigh” line shows the difference in means between the OJ-high cell and the OJ-low cell, also significant. The last two lines test various elements of the interaction.
